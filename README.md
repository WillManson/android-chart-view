# AndroidChartView
This is some code that I wrote back in 2012. I initially put it on Google Code.

This package allows you to utilise ChartView (a subclass of WebView) in your Android application. You can call methods on a ChartView object to easily add data to the charts of the ChartView.

Charts in the application are rendered using Google Chart Tools. Some charts are rendered via the Google Visualization API Simplification Layer.

ChartView works by opening a local HTML file, into which it injects JavaScript to render the charts.

Whilst the documentation in the Wiki section is fairly extensive, for standard usage you will only ever to need use HelpPageInstallation and HelpPageExampleUsage. The other pages, however, will be very useful if you intend to edit or adapt the Java package in any way.

Enjoy!
